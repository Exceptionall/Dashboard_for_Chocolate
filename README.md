- **Data normalization**: Ensured consistent data types for fields such as dates and numbers.
- **Data filtering**: Removed irrelevant records that were outside the scope of analysis (e.g., products that were no longer sold).

### Step 3: Data Visualization
Power BI was used to create visualizations that cover:
- Sales over time, broken down by month and year.
- Revenue comparison across regions.
- Popular product categories.
- Customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
